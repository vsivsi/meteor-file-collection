## fileCollection Sample App

This demo app uses fileCollection's built-in support for [Resumable.js](http://www.resumablejs.com/) to allow drag and drop uploading of files. Beyond that, it presents a simple file management table with basic metadata, user acounts with file ownership, previews of images with click to load, and the ability to download or delete files.

To set-up, make sure you have [meteorite](https://atmospherejs.com/docs/installing) installed.

Then just run `mrt` in this directory. Once that is done, you simply run `meteor` and point your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.
